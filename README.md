Multiple Linear Regression for House Price Prediction 🏡💰

This project demonstrates a Multiple Linear Regression model that predicts house prices based on features like size (sq ft), number of bedrooms & bathrooms, distance from the city, and house age. The model is evaluated using metrics such as MAE, MSE, and R² 📊. An interactive Streamlit app is provided to visualize the results and make real-time predictions 🚀.
